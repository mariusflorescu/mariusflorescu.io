## 2021

I've been constantly saying in the last 7-8 months that _I will definitely finish my blog this month_, but unfortunately they we're all lies, due to the fact that I was looking for perfection and uniqueness.

Going through at least **5 iterations**, all almost completely different from the other, from the way they we're looking, the technologies I was using and the enormous quantity of _useless_ features added just to show-off my UI skills.

However, on the _31st of December_, everything changed from the moment that I started designing and coding each iteration.

## Now

> "Your creation is never ready..." - Rauno Freiberg

After reading Rauno's article, [Real artists ship](https://rauno.me/writing/real-artists-ship), the idea of having a blog has changed dramatically.

That being said, today, the **1st of January 2022**, I've said to myself that I am going to finally _ship_ something, so I'm starting with a project that's personal and important to me, my personal website.

I've decided to create a place that _feels just like me_, without any "show-off stuff" that does not make any sense. Creating an interface with a simple yet clean UI, with just shades of gray, typography, whitespaces, and some gradients.

This is a place full of imperfections that make it _unique_ in its own way, a place that will probably be in a forever _work in progress_ state, a place that _I love_.

## What to expect

This blog will be a place where I share _thoughts and ideas_ that I find interesting and worth writing about, in a clumsy manner.

The articles are going to circle around the _UI/UX_ and _Frontend Engineering_ zone, all born from _curiosity_ and _inspiration_.
