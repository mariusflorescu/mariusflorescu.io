#### hi there, I'm Marius üëãüèΩ

a fullstack developer and student at Politehnica University Timisoara (Computer Engineering) who _loves_ building and experimenting modern solutions using cutting-edge technologies.

My _development journey_ as a fullstack developer started at the end of 2019, when I was in the first year of university and discovered React. I can certainly say that I have instantly fallen in love with it.
Shortly after, I wanted my projects to be more interactive so I went ahead and decided to learn more about backend, started by picking up Node with Mongo/Firebase and then learned the basics of SQL.

After a year of building my ideas where everything felt perfect, I wanted to step out of my comfort zone (February-March 2021) and applied to several outsourcing companies. This landed my first internship, which turned in an amazing full time job (where I'm still working) at [Victory Square Partners](https://www.linkedin.com/company/victorysqpartners).

I'm _learning by building_, always having a positive mindset accompanied by a _can-do_ attitude.

Mainly building _web applications_ with React, Next.js, Go, Node. Interested in design systems and learning Rust and Swift.

When I'm not working, I _enjoy_ listening to electronic music, watching a crazy load of youtube videos and hanging out with my friends.
